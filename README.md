Reflect on your project
a) Think about the strengths and weaknesses of your project.
My project achieves its core functionality --  generating random responses when the code is run. The application is also simple and customizable but could be a little bit hard for the average user to customize their question and responses. 

b) Think about areas that were particularly difficult to develop.
Even using the statements (var, default, break, case, let) was hard (I had to relearn them), and so the entire code was a little bit tricky to organize.

c) Think about any potential performance (speed/space) issues with your code.
Currently there are none but I think as I expand it there may be. If there are performance issues in the future, I will make sure to learn how to tackle them.

d) Think about the user interface and experience. For instance, how you interact with the code will be different from how I interact with it.
The average user is able to customize the questions and responses. However, it may be a bit hard for them to do it so I may have to give them a brief to let theme know how to customize it. Of course, on the flip side, I do know how to customize it. 

You might also consider
a) places in your code you don't/didn't understand
I understand all of it.
b) places where you utilized a library for functionality you probably could have written yourself 

I used the Swift library to get the Int.random(in:) because I definitely didn’t know how to write a random number generator by myself.

Finally, talk about ways you might improve your project to address some of the shortcomings above.  
a) Does it need a few tweaks here and there?

Yes. I think I should make instructions on how to customize it using the // feature for Swift (comment, isn’t code)

b) Do certain sections need a lot of work?

No.

c) Would it benefit from a complete rewrite?

No, but it would definitely benefit from add ons like the comment above, more responses, unique features that a normal 8 ball doesn’t have, etc.
