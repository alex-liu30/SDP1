Issue List So Far:

1. Typos
2. Limited Features
3. Semantic errors when editing for the first couple times

Incremental Changes: 

For Typos:

1. Do typing exercises every day to make sure I type with accuracy 99% of the time. @mrjloswald
2. Fix posture; as funny as it sounds, I think another reason why I keep mistyping stuff is because my posture is terrible when writing. Also probably explains why my back hurts... Anyway, I'll pay more attention to my posture and I'll make sure to straighten up whenever I catch myself bending down.

For Limited Features

1. Brainstorm and implement possible new features. @mrjloswald

For Semantic errors

1. Relearn all the Swift Keywords and practice using them (on Codecademy-- a website where you learn how to code). @mrjloswald
2. Think every time before thinking I'm done: "Does this make sense logically? Does the code seem like it would work based on how it's formatted" (this will definitely work because Swift -- at least for me -- is more logical compared to many other languages) @mrjloswald
